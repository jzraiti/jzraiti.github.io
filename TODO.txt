Move all background pics to same folder and remake dynamic backgrounds thing

Take topbar and break it out into a seperate item so that it is consistant throughout

Fix formatting on published research

Can make an old projects tab that includes augmented reality etc

Annotated papers? This is a good idea but what do I actually want here. Maybe papers I am reading? Summaries of them as best I understand.

Add mycoweekly

Add bat_gogh and portobello_picasso

Add Current Research page - spore shape etc, is there a published page about this? Maybe link to pringle lab website somehow

Port over to Tailwind CSS


    <!-- Navbar Placeholder -->
    <div id="navbar-placeholder"></div>
    <script>
      // Dynamically load the navbar component
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        fetch("Components/navbar.html")
          .then(response => response.text())
          .then(data => {
            document.getElementById("navbar-placeholder").innerHTML = data;
          })
          .catch(error => console.error("Error loading navbar:", error));
      });
    </script>


Ok. I want to modernize the code I have to utilize the maximum benefits of tailwind CSS.
